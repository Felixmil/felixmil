### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Felix MIL. I'm an R and python enthusiast that codes at work and sometimes at home for fun and dreams about working at RStudio one day.

I'm the creator of :game_die:[RollR](https://github.com/Felixmil/rollR), an unsignificant R and badly written package that let you throw dices in a roleplaying-games-fashion way.

You can find my resume [here](resume-fr.md).
